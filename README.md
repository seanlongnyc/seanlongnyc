Howdy,

I've moved back to NYC, building a new home lab, and have different skillsets from when I left years ago. Thought it was time to bring it all together in a new Github. Here I will be focusing on:
- Kubernetes
- DevOps
- Observiablity tools
  
There are many great reasons to use Kubernetes but I will start by exploring the different IDPs which hopefully I'll have the hardware to run in parrallel in their own vClusters. Additionally, I have a strong interest in cyber security (build zero-trust networks!)
& have been getting more involved with CTFs. 

Hopefully gathering folks interested in working together on CTFs & projects in the city. Actively hunting locations to host us
